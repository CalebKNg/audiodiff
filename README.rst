=========

audiodiff is a commandline tool that compares two audio files and prints
info whether audio streams and/or tags differ. It can compare two directories
recursively, like ``diff -r``. You can choose to compare only audio streams,
tag contents, or both.

You have to install audiotools_ to compare audio streams.
